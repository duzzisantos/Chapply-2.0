# Chapply-2.0
Chapply is a job application program that contains three pages - the job advert, forms generated based on the user's consent and the confirmation page.
The inputs and buttons generated are appended to the forms, while the form scrolls to make the next content visible.
It is an interactive job application form generated based on a setTimeout() function, to keep the user hooked.
